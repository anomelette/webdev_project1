    <h1>Cats</h1>  
      <p>Cats are my favorite animal because they are very cute. Here are some examples of cute cats:</p>
      <img src="media/cat1.jpg" width="1060" height="707" alt="Orange cat laying on white sheets facing camera.">
      <p>The orange cat above is very cute. He is looking very intently at the camera.</p>
      <p>Below is an adorable fluffy kitten. It is also looking at the camera.</p>
      <img src="media/cat2.jpg" width="540" height="540" alt="Small, cute fluffy kitten sitting on a cushion.">
      <img src="media/cat3.jpg" width="540" height="540" alt="2 hairless cats sitting on a catree, left cat wearing a yellow sweater, right cat wearing a blue-gray sweater.">
      <p>Unpopular opinion but I love hairless cats. These ones above are so cute in their matching sweaters.</p>
      <p>Here is a video of even more <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgIgKcqPd4k">cute cats!</a></p>
